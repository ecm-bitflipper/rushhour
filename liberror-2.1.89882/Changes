2.1.89882
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- There are now separate filters for developer and normal messages.
  The command line parser was extended accordingly, so you can
  write, e.g., --msg-hide=devel-info.

- The debug function err_flush_buffers() was made extern.
  ONLY use it for debugging!

2.1.80011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- the err_position stuff now uses reference counting so that
  there is much less copying when such objects are passed around

- the ERR_MODULE_TOKEN is now translated to with err_group() via
  a cache so that the C_TAG_... macros are much faster when ERR_MODULES_TOKEN
  is used.

- when everything is broken and nothing is printed, you can use the
  env. variable MSG_FORCE_FPRINTF to force the library to simply
  invoke fprintf.

- a typo was fixed so that 'never' is now recognised on the cmd line

- warnings fixed for newer gcc

- free more memory (filtering and stream handling)

- exported the argument and environment parser:
  - err_opt_parse()
  - err_opt_parse_args()
  - err_opt_parse_string()

- added err_location_copy() and err_location_delete() for C programmers

- added err_group_set_prefix() and err_group_get_prefix().  The programmer
  can set a prefix to print for all messages of a certain group.


2.1.58643
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- switch to version numbers using svn revision
- add debian package support
- added support for XML report files
- fixed compilation for newer gccs

2.0.62
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Made compiling under Linux a bit faster for tar.bz2 version.
  It did some unnecessary remakes (it still does, but less).

2.0.61
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Additional to --msg-crash, which generates an artificial
  SIGSEGV, I also added:
   +----------------+----------------------------------------+
   | --msg-assert0  | raises an artificial assertion         |
   |                | (for testing whether the binary        |
   |                | includes assertions, i.e, was compiled |
   |                | with -DNDEBUG).                        |
   +----------------+----------------------------------------+
   | --msg-forever  | starts an endless loop until you       |
   |                | attach to the binary from a debugger   |
   |                | and 'set err_continue=1'               |
   +----------------+----------------------------------------+
- fixed building of the source package so that all files
  are included for out-of-the-box Windows compilation.
  For compilation and installation, type:

     : nmake -f nmakefile
     : nmake -f nmakefile install

  The default installation prefix is E:\WINNT.  To change,
  use:

     : make -f nmakefile WIN_PREFIX=blahblah install
     :

- The assert() macro in error/assert.h was fixed to
  work for nested asserts


2.0.49
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug fix for --err-{hide,suppress}-{subsystem,group} for
  multiple comma-separated values.  The bug lead to in
  infinite loop consuming memory and eventually this
  lead to a crash.


2.0.40
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug fix in Erwin (err_v_char.cpp would not compile
  on some systems).

- Bug in usage of 'which' in 'makeerwin', which breaks
  the script in some shells (notably BSD).

- While fixing the above bug, it was noticed that 'makeerwin'
  is missing in the source code distro file.
  Added.

- parseargs: add support for err_set_fatal_count()

- Fixed bug so that C_TAG_PREFIX will successfully
  set the next_location.  It was accidentally cleared
  right after setting it.

  This also changes the semantics of a prefix: a prefix
  and a suffix will be kept until the user manually
  invokes err_prefix/suffix_erase.  This was done since
  it is not nice when debug messages use the prefix that
  was meant for another message.

2.0.16
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For compatibility reasons, the "err-" prefix is still
  understood.  To prevent this compatibility, use

     : #define ERR_CUT_COMPAT ERR_BASE_VERSION(2,0)

  or add a CPPFLAG:
     : -DERR_CUT_COMPAT='ERR_BASE_VERSION(2,0)'

  The means that compatibility is supported for
  features introduced in versions >= 2.0.x only,
  i.e., no compatibility for features only found in
  versions < 2.0.x.  (The sub-version is not included
  in the comparison, still the macro always takes
  three arguments)

  This may result is smaller and faster code (though
  it's currently neglectible).

- Fixed a bug in err_count() that led to wrong results
  for parameters (0,0).

- Fixed some problems in the make subdir where targets
  depended on special tools (most of them part of Erwin).


2.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed the default prefix from "err" to "msg", since we
  can handle messages, not only errors.

  To switch back to old behaviour -- you should not do this,
  but in case you really want this, use:

     : err_set_config_prefix ("err");

  This must be invoked before the call to err_init().

- added a lot of documentation

- added the command line tool |eprintf|

- symbols are now installed, so the user has access to the
  library's symbol table by
     : err_string2symbol()

- user can override PID now:
     : err_pid()
     : err_set_pid()

1.x
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- First release.
